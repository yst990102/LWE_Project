DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP generate_Matrix_B/row_sum_accurate1 input pin generate_Matrix_B/row_sum_accurate1/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.
